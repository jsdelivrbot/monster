# Scotch Box

This repository uses Scotchbox 3 for its development environment.

# Drupal 8 - monster-api.dev

The back-end content creation is a standard installation of Drupal 8 
and has a content type 'Monster Data' set up as a Restful API.

# Vue 2 - bloodthirstymonsters.dev

The front-end and main testbed for the site.  I haven't had a chance to play around with 
a JS framework since AngularJS near the beginning of my coding journey.  After reading up on the pro's
and cons of Angular2/React/Vue I have decided Vue contains everything I need and less of what I don't.

# Goals

This will continue to be updated as the project develops.
 
1. My first ambition was to create a 2 site setup, within a single Scotchbox.
2. Next I wanted to set up the content-type as a RESTful API and access/display the data at bloodthirstymonsters.dev.

With these goals successfully completed I now need to put some more thought into the actual design and ensure I
make regular commits throughout the whole process!

3. ... tbc. :)
